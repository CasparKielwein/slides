# Consciences
* I am good because I do good
    * Moral Codes
    * Doing good work
* Strengthened through Recognition from others

# Back to Reviews
* Judging my Code  
  => Judging me?  
  => I will defend my self-worth!
* Technical Discussions become personal
* cannot be resolved on technical level

# Responsibility
* We are given great Power

# What can we do?
* Acknowledge the responsibility
* Praise generously
* Don't review while angry
* Avoid "you" statements
* reframe requests as questions  
    "what do you think about x?"
